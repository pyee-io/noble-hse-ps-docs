## Assurance Activities Consistency
**Inconsistencies Found:** 2 items

#### Ventilation System - Hazardous Areas | **frequency:** 3M

| Variation Type | Content / Diff | Rigs |
|---|---|---|
| 🔵 **Baseline** | **description:** Shut down ventilation in enclosed hazardous areas<br>- Mud pit room;<br>- Shaker house; and<br>- any other enclosed hazardous areas in line with the hazardous area plan.<br>Confirm that it initiates an alarm in a manned stations, when the pressure differential is less than 50 Pa.<br><br><br>**pass_criteria:** Confirmed that loss of hazardous area ventilation leads to an alarm in a manned station. | Noble Mick O'Brien, Noble Regina Allen |
| 🔴 **Variance** | **description:** Shut down ventilation in enclosed hazardous areas<br>- Mud pit room;<br>- Shaker house; and<br>- any other enclosed hazardous areas in line with the hazardous area plan.<br>Confirm that it initiates an alarm in a manned stations, when the pressure differential is less than {==50Pa==}.<br><br><br>**pass_criteria:** Confirmed that loss of hazardous area ventilation leads to an alarm in a manned station. | Noble Tom Prosser |

#### Ventilation System - Non hazardous Areas | **frequency:** 3M

| Variation Type | Content / Diff | Rigs |
|---|---|---|
| 🔵 **Baseline** | **description:** Overpressure is maintained at:<br>- Driller's Cabin<br>- Other enclosed non-hazardous areas adjacent to hazardous areas as shown on Hazardous Area plan. <br>Confirm that an alarm is given at manned station upon loss of pressure differential for non-hazardous rooms adjacent to hazardous areas. This can be tested by shutting off the ventilation or by keeping doors open until the pressure is equalised.<br><br><br>**pass_criteria:** Confirmed that loss in differential pressure leads to an alarm in a manned station. | Noble Mick O'Brien, Noble Regina Allen |

## Technical Perf Requirements Existence
**Inconsistencies Found:** 2 items

#### Ventilation system - Galley

| Variation Type | Content / Diff | Rigs |
|---|---|---|
| 🔵 **Baseline** | **requirement:** Upon activiation of water mist in the galley, the ICMS (Kongsberg) shall automatically shut down the air handling units and exhaust fan and close related dampers as per F&G Cause and Effects. | Noble Regina Allen |
| ⚪ **Missing** | *(Item not present for these rigs)* | Noble Tom Prosser, Noble Mick O'Brien |

#### Ventilation system - Galley Areas protected by water mist

| Variation Type | Content / Diff | Rigs |
|---|---|---|
